PhysiCell is an open source, agent-based simulation framework for simulating complex multicellular systems. It simulates the chemical environment (diffusion of substrates and signaling factors), individual cell behaviors, and cell-cell interactions. It can be tailored to a broad variety of problems in cancer, infectious diseases, developmental biology, immunology, micro-ecosystems, and more.
